# bus-registration
Due to excessive administrative actions, the CTU Training Solutions preferred to move from  a paper base bus registration system to an online bus registration system.  The purpose of this project is to examine the paper base bus registration system and to design, develop, implement, test and deploy.

The system must be designed and developed as an online system, that is both web-based and 
mobile-friendly. For demonstra,on purposes, the system and database must be hosted locally.

Remember that the payment of 2ckets are op2onal and not part of the requirements for the 
Online Bus Registra2on System.
The learner can make use of bus transport in the morning and the afternoon or just in the 
morning or just in the afternoon.
Buses have limited space thus:
• Bus 1 can transport 35 learners
• Bus 2 can transport 15 learners
• Bus 3 can transport 15 learners
Action(s) from the parent:
• Register his or her learner on the Online Bus Registration System
• Apply for the Bus Transport for 2024 for his or her learner
• The parent will receive an e-mail from the School to acknowledge the registration 
and application processes (if the application is successful?)
• If the application was not successful the student will be placed on a waiting list
• The parent will receive an e-mail if the learner is moved from the waiting list to the 
Online Bus Registration System
• Cancel the application for the Bus Transport for 2024
Action(s) from the administrator:
• Register learners on the Online Bus Registration System
• Apply for the Bus Transport for 2024 on behalf of the learner
• Move learners from the waiting list to the Online Bus Registration System if space 
becomes available
