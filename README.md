# bus-registration
Due to excessive administrative actions, the CTU Training Solutions preferred to move from  a paper base bus registration system to an online bus registration system.  The purpose of this project is to examine the paper base bus registration system and to design, develop, implement, test and deploy.

The system must be designed and developed as an online system, that is both web-based and 
mobile-friendly. For demonstra,on purposes, the system and database must be hosted locally.
